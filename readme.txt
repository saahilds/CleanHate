CleanOldFashionedHate is a game in which the user controls Buzz and attempts to score a touchdown without getting tackled by Hairy (UGA mascot). 
The user can use the up, down, left, and right keys to move Buzz. There is unlimited time, but if Buzz gets tackled once, the game is over. 

The first screen is the welcome screen; press enter to advance.
The second screen is the instruction screen; press enter to advance.
The third screen is the gameplay; Buzz will be moved around until he is either tackled by Hairy (lose) or reaches the endzone (win). 
The fourth screen will either be the win screen that congratulates the user or the loss screen that consoles the user; 
both screens direct the user to press enter to return to the beginning screen.
